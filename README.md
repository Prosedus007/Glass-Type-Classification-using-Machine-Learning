# ðŸ§ª Glass Type Prediction using Machine Learning

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This project aims to classify types of glass based on their chemical properties using various machine learning models. The dataset used is the **Glass Identification Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The primary objective is to compare the performance of different classifiers such as:
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Multi-layer Perceptron (Neural Network)

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Information

- **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository â€“ Glass Identification Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/glass+identification)
- **Features:** 9 chemical attributes (e.g., RI, Na, Mg, etc.)
- **Target:** Glass type (multi-class classification)

---

## ðŸ”§ Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Checked for missing values
   - Standardized features using `StandardScaler`

2. **Dimensionality Reduction**
   - Applied PCA to retain 95% variance

3. **Modeling**
   - Trained five classifiers using stratified train-test split (80-20)
   - Evaluated using classification report, confusion matrix, and ROC curves

4. **Visualization**
   - Feature distribution, boxplots, and correlation heatmaps
   - Model-wise ROC curves and accuracy comparison bar chart

## ðŸ“Š Model Performance

| Model                 | Accuracy |
|----------------------|----------|
| Random Forest         | ~0.93    |
| SVM                   | ~0.88    |
| Neural Network (MLP)  | ~0.86    |
| KNN                   | ~0.84    |
| Decision Tree         | ~0.82    |

> ðŸ“Œ *Note: Accuracy values may vary slightly due to random state and data splits.*
